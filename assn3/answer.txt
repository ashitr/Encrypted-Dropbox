Local IP addresses are:
IP address : 10.0.2.2, MAC address = 04:0c:ce:d8:0f:fa and Manufacturer = Apple
IP address : 10.0.2.3, MAC address = 8c:a9:82:50:f0:a6 and Manufacturer = Intel,

The given network looks like a large corporation.
Evidence: Since there are local addresses present so it's a local netwrok and the remaining traffic comes from just a single MAC address which is possible only in the case of a gateway device to the local network
MAC of gateway: Apple_(00:26:08:e5:66:07)

While HTTPS encrypts the entire HTTP request and response, the DNS resolution and connection setup can reveal other information, such as the full domain or subdomain and the originating IP address.

The Facebook is managing the session through the cookies and they are not encrypted hence vulnerable.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
[5.b]
Since the cookies aren't encrypted, anyone doing packet sniffing can get the cookies and impersonate the user.

The user sent a bunch of image/gif and http requests and got an 200 OK response so basically browsed facebook for a while successfully.
